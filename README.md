>[!CAUTION]
> # This project is unfinished and discontinued
> There is not much left to add, but I no longer have the motivation to complete it.

> [!WARNING]
> # ⚠️ This repository includes ***horrendous*** code ⚠️
> When I started working on this project(~9 months before uploading it to GitHub), I knew ***nothing***. I learned everything while working on it. That is why most of the older classes are very poorly written and even completely unreadable. I was aware of this situation when I started getting good but I did not touch the old code for historical purposes ~~and not because I am lazy or anything~~. Newer classes (like the ones in the render package) should have way better codes that I can almost be proud of.

# ABOUT THE PROJECT
This app is a replica of Minecraft Java Edition 1.8.9 for Android. Microsoft login and Minecraft server protocols are implemented, so it is possible to login with your Microsoft account and play on real Minecraft servers such as Hypixel. It uses the same graphics engine(OpenGL), same assets/models and the same gameplay mechanics as Minecraft.

> [!NOTE]
> This project has great importance to me because it resembles my Java journey. I spent hundreds of hours on this project, and learned so much (almost everything I know about Java is because of this project). It is possible to see how much I improved by going through the code chronogically.

# FEATURES THAT ARE NOT IMPLEMENTED _YET(?)_
- Text rendering (nametags etc.)
- Interacting with blocks/entities (This should be very easy to add now since it can already detect the block/entity that is targeted by crosshair but idk)
- idk nothing major probably

# SCREENSHOTS
TODO
